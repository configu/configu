- `Configu CLI` is a lightweight binary that is available for every major operating system, Docker, and CI/CD tool. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing configurations through the command line.
- `Configu SDK` is a library that can be configured as a dependency in your application. It allows you to manage your configurations as code and provides a simple and consistent way to access configuration data in your application.
- `ConfigSchema file (<uid>.cfgu.json)` is a human-readable, open-sourced format for declaring configurations and their characteristics. It is designed to be stored in your source control alongside the code that uses these configurations and is safe to be treated as code.
- `Configu Cloud` is a SaaS tool that provides a one-stop-shop for all configuration needs, from development to production. It offers advanced capabilities such as automation, visualization, testing, security, and tracking. The Configu cloud has a free-forever Community plan.
- `Configu IDE plugin` is a plugin that integrates directly with the development environment (IDE) and provides immediate feedback on configuration issues.

The diagram below shows a high-level flow of Configu's open-source components together with the Configu Cloud.
