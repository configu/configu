title: Configu Interface Configuration File
sidebarTitle: .configu
description: 'The `.configu` file is an optional configuration file used by the various Configu interfaces to customize its behavior. The file should be named `.configu` regardless of the format used: JSON or YAML.'
---

## Location

Configu interfaces recursively search for the `.configu` file starting from the current working directory and continuing up to the user's home directory. Once it finds a `.configu` file, it uses it solely and stops searching.

## Format

The `.configu` file can be written in one of the following formats: `YAML` or `JSON`. The file should be named `.configu` regardless of the format used.

## $schema

include the `$schema` property at the beginning of the file to specify the `Cfgu` version to communicate to other readers and tooling which specification version is intended.
Also, most modern editors will use this property to provide IntelliSense and validation for the `Cfgu` file.

```yaml YAML
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-configu
```

```json JSON

  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-configu"
}
```

## Properties

### stores

The `.configu` file allows you to save `ConfigStore` configurations as friendly names, which can be later used as values for the `--store` flag in all the commands.

To define a `ConfigStore`, add a new key-value pair to the `stores` section of the `.configu` file, where the key represents the friendly name, and the value is an object with the `type` and `configuration` properties. The `type` property represents the store type, and the `configuration` property contains the specific configuration options for the store.

Additionally, you can activate the caching for a specific store by adding the `cache` property to the store configuration object and set it to `true`.

For detailed information about the available store options, please refer to the relevant store on the [intergrations section](/integrations/overview#configstore).

### cache

The `.configu` file allows you to define the cache file path for the Configu CLI. The cache is used to store the results of the `configu eval` command to provide failsafe and faster access to the results.

To define the cache configuration, add a new key-value pair to the `.configu` file, where the key is `cache`, and the value is path to the cache file.

By default, the cache file is stored in the os cache directory as follows:

- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/configu/config.sqlite`
- Unix: `~/.cache/configu/config.sqlite`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\configu\config.sqlite`

### schemas

The `.configu` file allows you to save `ConfigSchema` paths as friendly names, which can be later used as values for the `--schema` flag in all the commands.

To define a custom script, add a new key-value pair to the `schemas` section of the `.configu` file, where the key represents the friendly name, and the value is the schema absolute or relative path.

### scripts

The `.configu` file allows you to save `Configu CLI` snippets as friendly names, which can be later used as values for the `--script` flag in the `configu run --script <label>` command.

To define a custom script, add a new key-value pair to the `scripts` section of the `.configu` file, where the key represents the friendly name, and the value is the script content. The script content should consist of `Configu CLI` commands or a pipe of commands.

<Tip>
  The `.configu` configuration file provides a way to customize the behavior of the Configu CLI. By defining custom
  stores and scripts in this file, you can easily reference them in CLI commands, making it more convenient to manage
  and collaborate on software configurations.
  <br />
  Remember that the `.configu` file is optional, and if present, it will be automatically discovered by the CLI during
  its recursive search process.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```yaml YAML
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
stores:
  store1:
    cache: true
    type: storeType1
    configuration:
      option1: value1
      option2: value2
  store2:
    type: storeType2
    configuration:
      option3: value3
      option4: value4
schemas:
  schema1: ../path/to/schema1.json
  schema2: /path/to/schema2.json
scripts:
  script1: 'configu command1 --option1 value1'
  script2: 'configu command2 --option2 value2 | configu command3'
```

```json JSON
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "stores": {
    "store1": {
      "cache": true,
      "type": "storeType1",
      "configuration": {
        "option1": "value1",
        "option2": "value2"
      }
    },
    "store2": {
      "type": "storeType2",
      "configuration": {
        "option3": "value3",
        "option4": "value4"
      }
    }
  },
  "schemas": {
    "schema1": "../path/to/schema1.json",
    "schema2": "/path/to/schema2.json"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "script1": "configu command1 --option1 value1",
    "script2": "configu command2 --option2 value2 | configu command3"
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

The `.configu` file allows you to use environment variables in its different sections. This comes in handy for `store configuration options` or `scripts` when you want to avoid explicitly writing sensitive authentication credentials etc. and you want to inject them from the outside before running Configu. To use an environment variable, you can utilize [mustache templating](https://mustache.github.io/) as such:

```yaml
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
stores:
  store1:
    type: 'storeType1',
    configuration:
      option1: 'value1',
      password: '{{PASSWORD}}',
```

You can then pass the environment variable to the CLI using any method of setting environment variables to replace the mustache template with the environment variable value. Here is an example of passing an environment variable to the CLI by using an operating system specific prefix:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Linux/MacOS
PASSWORD=password configu eval --store store1 --set <value> --schema <value> [-c <value>]
```

```bash Windows
set PASSWORD=password && configu eval --store store1 --set <value> --schema <value> [-c <value>]
```
