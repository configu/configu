## Breaking Changes

### `.cfgu` file changes

#### File structure changes

The file structure of `.cfgu` files has significantly changed to provide a more robust structure.

Link to new `.cfgu` JSONSchema: https://github.com/configu/configu/blob/main/packages/schema/.cfgu.json

To update a `.cfgu` file to the new structure, the `Cfgu` declarations need to be moved under the `keys` property.

Previous `start.cfgu.yaml`
Previous `

- all keys-> keys prop
