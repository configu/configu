title: Configs Compare
---

The Configs Compare feature simplifies the process of comparing configurations between two [sets](/introduction/concepts#configset) in your organization.
By selecting the base set on the left input and choosing another set to compare on the right, you can easily view and analyze the differences.

This feature presents all the keys from both sets, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the configurations.
In case there are similar keys with varying values between the sets, they are conveniently highlighted. This allows for quick identification and comparison of the variations.
