title: Activity Logs
---

Configu's activity logs let you know when changes are made and by whom.
From modifying a configuration to adding a new team member, Configu will generate logs for every action your team members make.

Activity logs record all actions going through the Configu Cloud, including who performed it and when, from which interface, and which CRUD operations were made on configs or sets.

They help you learn:

- Who added or updated a configuration recently
- Which service pulls its latest configurations and when
