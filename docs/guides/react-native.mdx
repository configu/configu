title: React Native with Configu
description: "Learn how to use React Native with `Configu`. We'll use the `Configu CLI` and the `Configu ConfigStore` (Configu Platform) to declare, initialize, and export a simple set of configuration data which you can use in your React Native app"
---

import CliInstallSnippet from '/snippets/cli-install.mdx';

### 1. Install Configu CLI

<CliInstallSnippet />

## 2. Create schema declaration

```shell
configu init
```

## 3. Connect to Configu ConfigStore

You may now choose one of the many ConfigStore integrations that are available as your source of configurations for your React Native app. In this guide, we will use the [Configu ConfigStore](/integrations/store/configu) our chosen ConfigStore.

```shell
configu login
```

<Info>
The [Configu `ConfigStore`](https://app.configu.com/) is a convenient way to get started with Configu, especially for users who are new to the tool. It is a configuration management platform that is easy to use and requires minimal setup, with a free starter plan option.

To get started with [Configu Platform](https://app.configu.com/), you'll need to [register and create a new organization](https://app.configu.com/).

## 4. Upsert values

```shell
configu upsert \
  --store 'configu' --set 'development' --schema './start.cfgu.json' \
  --config "GREETING=hey" --config "SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>" \
&& configu upsert \
  --store 'configu' --set 'development/qa' --schema './start.cfgu.json' \
  -c "GREETING=hola" \
&& configu upsert \
  --store 'configu' --set 'production' --schema './start.cfgu.json' \
  -c "GREETING=welcome"
```

## 5. Export values

```shell
configu eval \
  --store 'configu' --set 'development/qa' --schema './start.cfgu.json' \
| configu export \
  --format "Dotenv" \
> ".env"
```

As a result, you will get a `.env` file with the configurations declared in the "get-started" ConfigSchema and their values from the "test" ConfigSet.

```.env
GREETING=welcome
SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>
MESSAGE=welcome, <YOUR_NAME>!
```

## 6. Using the exported values in your React Native app

That's it! You can now use the `.env` file in your React Native app to access the configuration values. The React Native team recommends using the [Expo framework](https://expo.dev) which has [in-built support for environment variables](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables). If you use a framework other than Expo, you can refer to the documentation of that framework to learn how to use environment variables.
