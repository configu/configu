## Prerequisites

- Access permissions to create a WebHook for Github Actions.
- Configu Cloud organization with admin permissions (if you donn't have an account, get one free [here](https://app.configu.com))

## Create a Configu Webhook

1. Define your target workflow payload URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{action-id}/dispatches`, example:

2. Customize your header to include an `Authorization` header with your GitHub personal access token. Example:

3. Customize your payload to contain the data you need, for this example:
   <Frame>![image](/images-old/webhooks/github-customize-your-payload.png)</Frame>
   you will need to send the following payload data:
   <Frame>![image](/images-old/webhooks/github-customize-your-payload-2.png)</Frame>

- `ref` is the branch that contains the workflow definition
- `inputs` is the data that the workflow will use that is sent from the webhook
