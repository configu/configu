## Create a Slack Incoming WebHook

For this integration to work, you'll need a Slack [Incoming WebHook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
Browse to that URL and follow the steps.

Get your target payload URL which looks something like this: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
The standard way is by enabling incoming webhooks on a custom app you installed on your Slack workspace and creating a webhook as such:

## Create a Configu Webhook

1. Browse to the Webhooks page (/integrations/webhooks) in your Confgu Cloud organization.
2. Create a new webhook using the Slack Payload URL you obtained in the previous step.
3. Customize your payload to include a `text` property with some message, and then click Create.
