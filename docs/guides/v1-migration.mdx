## Breaking Changes

### `Cfgu` format changes

V1 introduces several breaking changes to `.cfgu` files. Below is a list of the breaking changes and how to update your `.cfgu` files.

#### `Cfgu` property changes

- The `type` property has been removed and replaced with the [new `test` property](/interfaces/.cfgu#properties).
- The `options` property has been renamed to `enum` to better reflect its purpose.
- The `depends` property has been removed. If you need to replicate it, you can use the [new `test` property](/interfaces/.cfgu#properties).
- The `labels` property has been renamed to `label`.

#### `.cfgu` file structure change

The file structure of `.cfgu` files has significantly changed to provide a more robust structure.

To update a `.cfgu` file to the new structure, the `Cfgu` declarations need to be moved under the `keys` property.

We will provide an example of how to migrate this example `.cfgu` file:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml example.cfgu.yaml
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-cfgu
NODE_ENV:
  description: Defines the environment in which the application runs
  type: String
  options:
    - development
    - production
    - test
  default: development
LOG_LEVEL:
  description: Defines the level of logs to be recorded
  type: String
  options:
    - error
    - warn
    - info
    - verbose
    - debug
    - silly
  default: info
SERVICE_ENDPOINT:
  description: Defines the endpoint for the service
  type: URL
  required: true
AWS_REGION:
  description: Defines the AWS region for the service
  type: AWSRegion
  default: us-east-1
```

```json example.cfgu.json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-cfgu",
  "NODE_ENV": {
    "description": "Defines the environment in which the application runs",
    "type": "String",
    "options": ["development", "production", "test"],
    "default": "development"
  },
  "LOG_LEVEL": {
    "description": "Defines the level of logs to be recorded",
    "type": "String",
    "options": ["error", "warn", "info", "verbose", "debug", "silly"],
    "default": "info"
  },
  "SERVICE_ENDPOINT": {
    "description": "Defines the endpoint for the service",
    "type": "URL",
    "required": true
  },
  "AWS_REGION": {
    "description": "Defines the AWS region for the service",
    "type": "AWSRegion",
    "default": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

After migration:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml example.cfgu.yaml
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-cfgu
keys:
  NODE_ENV:

    enum:

    test: isString
    enum:
      - error
      - warn
      - info
      - verbose
      - debug
      - silly
    default: info
  SERVICE_ENDPOINT:

}
```

#### `type` property removal

</CodeGroup>

### `.configu` file changes

The `cache` property has been renamed to `backup` to more accurately reflect its purpose. Replace all occurrences of `cache` with `backup` to reflect the new naming convention.

## Upgrading Configu CLI

TODO: get input from Ran
Install `@configu/cli` version 1.0.0 or later. Add snippet here.

## Upgrading Configu Proxy

TODO: get input from Ran
Install `@configu/proxy` version 1.0.0 or later.

## New Features

V1 introduces several new features to Configu. Below is a list of the new features and how to use them.

### Expressions

V1 introduces a new feature called expressions. Expressions allow you to write dynamic values with certain features like string interpolation, arithmetic operations, and more. All features that support expressions have their own injected context that can withing the expressions for evaluation.

The following features support expressions:

- [The new `test` `Cfgu` property](/interfaces/.cfgu#properties)
- [The new `const` `Cfgu` property](/interfaces/.cfgu#properties)
- [The `.configu` file](/interfaces/.configu#environment-variables)
- [The CLI export `filter` flag](http://localhost:3000/interfaces/cli/ref#configu-export)
- [The CLI export `format` flag](http://localhost:3000/interfaces/cli/ref#configu-export)
- [The CLI export `template` flag](http://localhost:3000/interfaces/cli/ref#configu-export)

Example usages of expressions:

`test` `Cfgu` property:

```yaml
keys:
  UPPERCASE_STRING:
    test: isString($.value)
```

The CLI export `filter` flag:

```yaml
configu eval --store store1 --set '' --schema ./tmp/schemas2/start.cfgu.yaml | configu export --filter 'empty($.value)' --filter 'contains($.cfgu.label,"a")'
```

The CLI export `format` flag:

```yaml
configu eval --store my-store --set '' --schema start.cfgu.yaml | configu export --format 'Dotenv({json:{{pipe}},wrap:true})'
```

The CLI export `template` flag, example template `.env` file:

```.env
SUBJECT={{SUBJECT}}
GREETING={{toUpper(GREETING)}}
```

### New `Cfgu` property `test`

The `test` property is a new property that allows you to write expressions to validate the value of a key. It replaces the `type` property which was removed due to its limited functionality.

### New `Cfgu` property `const`

The `const` property is a new property that allows you to write expressions to set a constant value for a key.

## Other changes

### `@configu/node` and `@configu/browser` removal

Any and all uses of these packages are no longer supported. We encourage all users of these packages to utilize [`@configu/cli`](https://docs.configu.com/interfaces/cli/overview) or [`@configu/proxy`](https://docs.configu.com/interfaces/proxy/overview) depending on your requirements. All ConfigStore implementations have been moved to `@configu/integrations`.

### `@configu/lib` removal

Superseded by `@configu/common` which is a package that provides shared functionality for the higher-level interfaces.

### `@configu/ts` removal

Superseded by `@configu/sdk`.

### Introduction of `@configu/integrations`

A new package that contains all ConfigStore implementations and libraries that extend the expressions functionality which are decoupled from the core `@configu/sdk` package. This package is intended to be used by higher-level configu interfaces such as the CLI and proxy.
