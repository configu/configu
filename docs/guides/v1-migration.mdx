## Breaking Changes

### `.cfgu` file changes

The file structure of `.cfgu` files has significantly changed to provide a more robust structure.

To update a `.cfgu` file to the new structure, the `Cfgu` declarations need to be moved under the `keys` property. Additionally, the `type` property has been removed so all `type` declarations need to be removed or converted to the [new `test` property](/interfaces/.cfgu#properties).

We will provide an example of how to migrate the [example `.cfgu` file](/interfaces/.cfgu#example):

{/* TODO: consider adding `test` to replace `type` */}

<CodeGroup>

```yaml example.cfgu.yaml
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-cfgu
keys:
  NODE_ENV:
    description: Defines the environment in which the application runs
    options:
      - development
      - production
      - test
    default: development
  LOG_LEVEL:
    description: Defines the level of logs to be recorded
    options:
      - error
      - warn
      - info
      - verbose
      - debug
      - silly
    default: info
  SERVICE_ENDPOINT:
    description: Defines the endpoint for the service
    type: URL
    required: true
  AWS_REGION:
    description: Defines the AWS region for the service
    default: us-east-1
```

```json example.cfgu.json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema-cfgu",
  "keys": {
    "NODE_ENV": {
      "description": "Defines the environment in which the application runs",
      "options": ["development", "production", "test"],
      "default": "development"
    },
    "LOG_LEVEL": {
      "description": "Defines the level of logs to be recorded",
      "options": ["error", "warn", "info", "verbose", "debug", "silly"],
      "default": "info"
    },
    "SERVICE_ENDPOINT": {
      "description": "Defines the endpoint for the service",
      "required": true
    },
    "AWS_REGION": {
      "description": "Defines the AWS region for the service",
      "default": "us-east-1"
    }
  }

### `.configu` file changes

- The `cache` property has been renamed to `backup` to more accurately reflect its purpose.

## Upgrading Configu CLI

## Upgrading Configu Proxy

TODO:

### Removal of `@configu/node` and `@configu/browser`

Any and all uses of these packages are no longer supported. We encourage all users of these packages to utilize [`@configu/cli`](https://docs.configu.com/interfaces/cli/overview) or [`@configu/proxy`](https://docs.configu.com/interfaces/proxy/overview) depending on your requirements.

## New Features
