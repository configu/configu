## ConfigStore

[ConfigStores](/introduction/concepts#configstore) are pivotal in managing your configurations effectively. Choose from a variety of storage solutions to fit your project's needs.

<Tip>
  In case you don't find a `ConfigStore` that meets your requirements, Configu allows you to easily create your own by
  [implementing a simple abstract class](https://github.com/configu/configu/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/ConfigStore.ts)
  with `get` and `set` methods. This flexibility empowers you to extend Configu and tailor it to your specific
  configuration management needs. Please also consider contributing your custom `ConfigStore` back to the community by
  submitting a pull request to the [Configu GitHub repository](https://github.com/configu/configu).
