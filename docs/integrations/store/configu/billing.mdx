The billing page allows you to manage your organization's subscription and track usage details.

<Note>
  Configu Orchestrator is open-source and free forever. For the Configu Cloud, we offer a generous free plan and we
  expect that many developers and teams will fall within this plan's limits. In this section, you can track how much you
  use and upgrade if needed. This section is only visible to the organization owner.

If you decide to downgrade to the "Starter" plan, you will retain your current plan until the end of the current billing period. After that, your plan will automatically switch to the "Starter" plan. You can reactivate your subscription at any time before the current billing period ends.
