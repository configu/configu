The billing page allows organization owners to manage their organization's billing plan and track usage details.

<Note>
  Configu Orchestrator is open-source and free forever. For the Configu Cloud, we offer a generous free "Starter" plan
  and we expect that many developers and teams will fall within this plan's limits. In this page, you can track how much
  you use and upgrade if needed.

To modify your plan, navigate to the "Current Plan" section and click "Upgrade." You will be prompted to make your desired changes. After selecting "Update," you will go through a confirmation process where you will see the outcome of your changes. Once confirmed, your plan will be updated immediately.

<Warning>
  Please note that you will not be refunded for downgrades such as seat removal, changing to a monthly billing interval,
  or removing add-ons.
</Warning>

If you decide to downgrade to the "Starter" plan, you will retain your current plan until the end of the current billing period. After that, your plan will automatically switch to the "Starter" plan. You can reactivate your subscription at any time before the current billing period ends.
