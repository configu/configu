The billing page allows organization owners to manage their organization's billing plan.

<Note>
  Configu Orchestrator is open-source and free forever. For the Configu Cloud, we offer a generous free Starter plan,
  which we expect will be sufficient for many developer teams. On this page, you can view the details of your current
  plan and upgrade if needed.

## Subscription Information

After clicking "Upgrade", you will be prompted to provide your billing information, which is used to charge you for the selected plan. See the [billing information](#billing-information) section for more details. Once you provide your billing information and click "Payment", you will be prompted to provide payment information. After a successful charge, your plan will be upgraded.

To modify your plan, navigate to the "Current Plan" section and click "Upgrade." You will be prompted to make your desired changes. After selecting "Update," you will go through a confirmation process where you will see the outcome of your changes. Once confirmed, your plan will be updated immediately.

<Warning>
  Please note that any downgrades such as seat removal, changing to a monthly billing interval, or removing add-ons,
  will reduce your billing going forward but will not result in a retroactive refund.
</Warning>

If you decide to downgrade to the "Starter" plan, you will retain your current plan until the end of the current billing period. After that, your plan will automatically switch to the "Starter" plan. You can reactivate your subscription at any time before the current billing period ends.

If you pay via credit card, you can update your card information by clicking "Change Method", which will prompt you to update your card details. If you have any outstanding balances, they will be charged after your payment method has been updated.
