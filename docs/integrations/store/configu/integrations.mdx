## GitHub

Configu lets you connect your GitHub repositories to your organization. Connecting your repositories enables the following features:

- Validate your ConfigSchema when you open pull requests.

To connect your GitHub repositories:

1. Go to the **Apps** page under the **Integrations** tab
2. Click the **Authorize** button under the GitHub integration section and you will be navigated to GitHub to continue the process
3. Select where you want to install the [Configu GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/configu)
4. Select which repositories you want to connect
5. You will automatically be returned to the **Apps** page with the installation complete

<Warning>
- Only a single GitHub account or GitHub organization can be connected to a Configu organization. A GitHub account or GitHub organization cannot be connected to more than one organization at a time.
- GitHub App installations may be suspended at any time directly from GitHub. This disables all features within the Configu Cloud that depend on the installation.
- Uninstalling the GitHub app directly from GitHub will automatically disconnect the app from your organization.

</Warning>

<Warning>

- **Automatic Integration Disconnection**: If the GitLab app is revoked directly from GitLab, the integration will automatically disconnect in Configu when you attempt to access integration features.  
- **Access Scope**: Configu will have read-only access to all repositories your GitLab account is associated with, including private and group repositories, and will display them accordingly.
