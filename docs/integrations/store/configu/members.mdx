## Adding Users

Users can be added to Configu using the following methods:

- Send Invite
- SAML Single Sign-On

New members are assigned the [default role](/integrations/store/configu/authorization#default-role) from the organization settings.

## Send Invite

Users can be manually invited to join an organization from the member's page. The account must be able to receive mail.
