Let's understand how Configu structures and visualize configurations.
The Configs pages are where you can view and manage your configurations.

The Config Explorer is a dashboard page that shows all the configuration data with a simple visualization.
You organize and view the data in **Sets** (e.g., environments, regions, branches, customers). You can view the details of a configuration in the **Configs** view.

You can also search and filter the data by:

- Set - set name or part of it
- Key - key name or part of it

## Graph View

The Graph view is the default view, and it shows all your [ConfigSets](/introduction/concepts#configset) on a graph, illustrating the relationships between them.

You can right-click any set to open the context menu and perform actions like viewing the configs or configs history, cloning the set, deleting it and more.

## Grid View

The Grid view displays all your [Configs](/introduction/concepts#config) in a grid layout. By default, each column represents a ConfigSet, and each row corresponds to a ConfigKey. Within the grid, each cell indicates the value of the config within its respective set.
Every config cell is interactive, allowing you to access the config value provided you have the necessary permissions.

Additionally, right-clicking on any cell within the grid unveils a context menu offering relevant actions. For instance, the `All Configs` context menu enables you to reveal all config values, transpose the grid, and revert any modifications you've made to the view.

Some notable actions include:
- **Pinning**: Pin the selected column or row to the left or top of the grid.
- **Sorting**: Sort the grid alphabetically or by last update date for columns or rows.
- **History**: View the history of the selected config or set.
- **Delete**: Delete the selected config or set.
- **Clone**: Clone the selected set.
- **Permissions**: View the permissions of the selected set or config.

## List View

The List view shows all the [Configs](/introduction/concepts#config) data you have permission for (e.g., set name, key, value, last update).
Admin can mask the values for security reasons.

You can show masked values, see the history of the config, or delete it (if you have permission).
